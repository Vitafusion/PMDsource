R script for the data analysis and simulation in the paper "The Poisson Multinomial Distribution and Its Applications in Voting Theory, Ecological Inference, and Machine Learning" by Zhengzhi Lin, Yueyao Wang, and Yili Hong. 

There are 8 sub-directories under this directory, they are pkg, Sec4.1, ... Sec5.3. The directory pkg includes the 2 packages we build and use for analysis and simulations. The directories Sec4.1 ,... Sec5.3 are named after Section 4.1, ... Section 5.3 in the paper. Each one of them containes 3 folders named code, data, and plot.

The code folders contain all analysis/simulation scripts for corresponding sections.

The plot folders contain all plots generated by analysis/simulations for the corresponding sections.

The data folders contain all data that is genrated by the analysis/simulations or raw data used by analysis/simulations.

The code is tested with arm (64-bit) and R version 4.1.0.
Simulations are running in Virginia Tech ARC device Tinkercliffs and Cascades.

For those who might test the packages in Tinkercliffs or Cascades, please use the Makevars file to specify the modules and flags.
